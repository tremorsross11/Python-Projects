# Python-Projects
A repository containing all of my python code.
My favorite projects I worked on were the web page generator(this opens up a small window using tkinter that lets you create your own html webpage)[https://github.com/tremorsross11/Python-Projects/blob/main/webpagegenerator2.py],
the file transfer program(this creates a small window where you can input the file source and destination which allows you to transfer your files to a new directory)[https://github.com/tremorsross11/Python-Projects/blob/main/file_transfer.py], and the phonebook application (It allows you to input your information and then stores it in a database)[https://github.com/tremorsross11/Python-Projects/tree/main/Phonebook].
